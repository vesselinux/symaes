SYMAES is a software tool that generates a system of polynomials in GF(2), corresponding to the round transformation and key schedule of the block cipher AES-128. SYMAES is written in Python and is executed within the computer algebra system Sage. For more details, refer to the paper: V. Velichkov, V. Rijmen, and B. Preneel, "SYMAES: A Fully Symbolic Polynomial System Generator for AES-128," In Workshop on Tools for Cryptanalysis 2010, F. Standaert (ed.), ECRYPT II, 2 pages, 2010.
